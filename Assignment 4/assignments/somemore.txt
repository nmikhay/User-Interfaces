Let's bring back the 'populations' array from a previous assignment
2. Use a for loop to compute an array called 'percentages2' containing the
percentages of the world population for the 4 population values. Use the
function 'percentageOfWorld1' that you created earlier
3. Confirm that 'percentages2' contains exactly the same values as the
'percentages' array that we created manually in the previous assignment,
and reflect on how much better this solution is
------
. Store this array of arrays into a variable called 'listOfNeighbours'
[['Canada', 'Mexico'], ['Spain'], ['Norway', 'Sweden',
'Russia']];
2. Log only the neighbouring countries to the console, one by one, not the entire
arrays. Log a string like 'Neighbour: Canada' for each country
3. You will need a loop inside a loop for this. This is actually a bit tricky, so don't
worry if it's too difficult for you! But you can still try to figure this out anyway ï¿½

Sum Array Exercise
Write a function called sumArray which accepts a single argument: an array of numbers.  It should return the sum of all the numbers in the array.

sumArray([1,2,3]) // 6
sumArray([2,2,2,2]) // 8
sumArray([50,50,1]) // 101
Hints:

You'll need a variable to keep track of the total.  It should start out as zero.

Loop over the array and for each element, add it to the total variable.

After you have added every number to total, return total.
-----
Please write a function called lastElement which accepts a single array argument.  The function should return the last element of the array (without removing the element).  If the array is empty, the function should return null.

lastElement([3,5,7]) //7
lastElement([1]) //1
lastElement([]) //null
